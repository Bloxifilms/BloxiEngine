# Friday Night Funkin' - Bloxi (Psych) Engine
Engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107) and mostly used by bloxifilms for his mods now. intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.
